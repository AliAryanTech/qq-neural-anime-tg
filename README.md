# What is this
A Telegram bot for making anime-styled pictures and videos from your source.
It's a simple bridge between Telegram and https://h5.tu.qq.com/web/ai-2d/cartoon/index

Demo: https://t.me/qq_neural_anime_bot

# Running your own bot
- run `yarn install`
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- put yout bot's token from BotFather into `.env`
- run `yarn start`

# Notes
- Probably the whole thing is going to break soon anyway
- Fork it and make your own version, because I don't think that I'm going to support it in the future
- For now you have to do something with the files folder by yourself
